To solve the problem of determining whether a directed graph $G$ has a **spiked Hamiltonian cycle**, we reduce it to the standard **Hamiltonian Cycle problem**. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the reduction and its correctness.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Hamiltonian Cycle**: A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in a directed graph that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.

2. **Spiked Hamiltonian Cycle**: A spiked Hamiltonian cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle that includes all but one vertex $v*{\text{spike}}$ in the cycle, with $v*{\text{spike}}$ connected to the cycle via a single edge.

### **Reduction**

Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, construct a modified graph $G' = (V', E')$ as follows for each vertex $v \in V$:

1. **Modify the Graph**:

   - Remove the vertex $v$ from $G$, producing a subgraph $G_v = (V \setminus \{v\}, E_v)$.
   - Check whether $G_v$ has a Hamiltonian cycle using the standard Hamiltonian Cycle algorithm.

2. **Add a Spike**:

   - If $G_v$ has a Hamiltonian cycle $C$, check if there exists an edge $(v, u) \in E$ or $(u, v) \in E$, where $u$ is a vertex in $C$.
   - If such an edge exists, the Hamiltonian cycle $C$ in $G_v$ can be "spiked" to include $v$ as a spiked Hamiltonian cycle.

3. **Repeat for All Vertices**:
   - Repeat the above steps for each $v \in V$. If any $G_v$ yields a spiked Hamiltonian cycle, return **YES**.

### **Correctness Argument**

1. **Necessity**:

   - If $G$ has a spiked Hamiltonian cycle, there must be some vertex $v*{\text{spike}}$ such that removing $v*{\text{spike}}$ leaves a graph $G*{v*{\text{spike}}}$ with a Hamiltonian cycle $C$.
   - Furthermore, $v\_{\text{spike}}$ must be connected to $C$ by a single edge, which is explicitly checked in the reduction.

2. **Sufficiency**:

   - If for some $v \in V$, the subgraph $G_v$ has a Hamiltonian cycle $C$, and there is a single edge connecting $v$ to $C$, then $G$ has a spiked Hamiltonian cycle.

3. **Uniqueness**:

   - The assumption that the Hamiltonian cycle is unique simplifies correctness, as we do not need to account for multiple Hamiltonian cycles in $G_v$.

4. **Polynomial Complexity**:
   - For a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices:
     - Constructing $G_v$ for each vertex $v$ takes $O(n^2)$ (removing a vertex and its edges).
     - Checking for a Hamiltonian cycle in $G_v$ is called $n$ times.
     - Hence, the total reduction runs in $O(n \cdot \text{HC}(n))$, where $\text{HC}(n)$ is the complexity of solving the Hamiltonian Cycle problem. Since this is polynomial in $n$ (by assumption), the reduction is polynomial.

### **Algorithm Summary**

1. For each vertex $v \in V$:
   - Construct the subgraph $G_v$.
   - Check for a Hamiltonian cycle $C$ in $G_v$.
   - If $C$ exists, check if $v$ can connect to $C$ via a single edge.
2. If any vertex $v$ produces a valid spiked Hamiltonian cycle, return **YES**; otherwise, return **NO**.

### **Conclusion**

This reduction correctly and efficiently transforms the problem of finding a spiked Hamiltonian cycle into a series of Hamiltonian Cycle problems, ensuring the solution is correct and runs in polynomial time given the polynomial-time Hamiltonian Cycle oracle.
